# Net-flow-method
This repository is created as my first try of Github, the codes which are included in this repo are of the net flow method, 
The net flow method is a method which is used to find the most desirable solution out of the entire population of the pareto optimal solution which was obtained from the Genetic algoritm NSGA-II.
The pareto optimal solutio already give the set of all non-dominated solutions, the operator has the decision to choose any point to be used as per the constrains which he has in hand.
But in the absense of any such constrains, it is just easier to choose the best solution out of all the solutions and just use that itself.
This code was prepared with the help of chatgpt and gemini collab, with me using AI to edit the code in such a way that it suits my case, i.e of reading the data directly from an excel sheet, giving the NFM point.
